    Scenario Outline: Generating tweets
        Given a list of tweets
        When we generate a <number> of new <length> character tweets
        Then the <new_number> and <new_length> of tweets is correct

        Examples: Tweet Number and Length
            | number    | new_number    | length    | new_length    |
            | 5         | 5             | 50        | 50            |
